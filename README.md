# Electra
Electra is a lightweight, secure web-based electronic voting system built with Django. Designed for simplicity and fairness, it allows authenticated users to vote once, hides vote counts until submission. Electra is ideal for student elections, small organizations, and prototype projects requiring a quick and reliable voting platform.
